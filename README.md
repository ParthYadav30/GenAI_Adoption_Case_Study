# üìä Is GenAI Stealing Our Jobs? | A SQL + Power BI Case Study

When I saw a reel saying *‚ÄúGenAI will steal all your jobs soon‚Äù*, it sparked a question in my head ‚Äî is that really happening?

So I rolled up my sleeves and built a full-stack data case study using:
- ‚úÖ **Python** for data preparation
- ‚úÖ **SQL** for analysis  
- ‚úÖ **Power BI** for interactive dashboards  
- ‚úÖ Dataset of 100000 Values from **Kaggle**

## üîç Case Study Summary

This case study explores how companies across the globe are adopting GenAI tools and the resulting impact on:
- Productivity
- Job creation vs job loss
- Employee sentiment
- Training investment

### Importing the Dataset
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\Parth Yadav\Downloads\archive (8)\Enterprise_GenAI_Adoption_Impact.csv")
df.head(5)
```
### Data Cleaning
```python
print(df.isnull().sum())
print(df.duplicated().sum())
df.columns.str.strip()
df.replace({'√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù': '-', '√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢': "'", '√¢‚Ç¨≈ì': '"', '√¢‚Ç¨¬ù': '"'}, regex=True, inplace=True)
df['GenAI Tool'] = df['GenAI Tool'].str.replace(r'\bgrok\b', 'Grok', case=False, regex=True)
df.head(20)
```
### Sentiment Categorization
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

sentiments = df['Employee Sentiment'].astype(str).str.lower()

vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english', max_features=1000)  # top 1000 keywords
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(sentiments)
keywords = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()

import numpy as np
word_freq = np.asarray(X.sum(axis=0)).flatten()
top_keywords = sorted(zip(keywords, word_freq), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

for word, freq in top_keywords[:50]:
    print(f"{word}: {freq}")

def map_sentiment_to_category(text):
    text = text.lower()
    positive_keywords = ['faster', 'efficient', 'improved', 'reduce', 'tasks', 'fun', 'ai']
    dynamic_keywords = ['roles', 'rotations', 'shifted', 'transition', 'new', 'smoother']
    negative_keywords = ['concern', 'replace', 'job', 'soon', 'scary', 'anxiety', 'struggling']
    learning_keywords = ['learning', 'curve', 'steep', 'adapted', 'helped', 'webinars']
    culture_keywords = ['collaboration', 'communicate', 'internal', 'hr', 'meetings', 'newsletter', 'townhalls']
    has_positive = any(word in text for word in positive_keywords)
    has_negative = any(word in text for word in negative_keywords)
    if has_positive and has_negative:
        return 'Mixed Impact'
    elif has_positive:
        return 'AI-Driven Productivity'
    elif any(word in text for word in dynamic_keywords):
        return 'Changing Job Dynamics'
    elif has_negative:
        return 'Job Security Anxiety'
    elif any(word in text for word in learning_keywords):
        return 'Learning & Adaptation'
    elif any(word in text for word in culture_keywords):
        return 'Communication & Culture Shift'
    else:
        return 'Uncategorized'

 df['Sentiment_Category'] = df['Employee Sentiment'].astype(str).apply(map_sentiment_to_category)


df[['Employee Sentiment', 'Sentiment_Category']].head()
```
### Final Checks
```python
uncategorized = df[df['Sentiment_Category'].isnull() | (df['Sentiment_Category'] == 'Uncategorized')]

print(f"Total Uncategorized Sentiments: {len(uncategorized)}")
uncategorized[['Employee Sentiment', 'Sentiment_Category']].head(10)
df.to_csv("cleaned_genai1.csv", index=False, encoding='utf-8')
